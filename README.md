## How to Play

In this game, you will be solving jigsaw puzzles of IU's pictures. As you complete each level, you will unlock the corresponding picture in your collection. The higher the level, the more difficult the puzzle and the less time you have to complete it.

## About IU:

In case you're not familiar with the K-pop queen herself, IU is a South Korean singer, actress, and all-around superstar. 

## Future Plans

I plan to add more pictures to the game and make the user interface more user-friendly. I also plan to make it a multiplayer game, so you can compete with other IU fans from all over the world. But who am I kidding, I'm probably just going to spend my time fangirling over IU and not doing any of that.

## Bug Reports

If you come across any bugs in the game, please do let me know. I'll pretend to look into it and then promptly ignore it, just like how IU ignores my DMs.

In conclusion, if you're an IU fan looking for a fun way to spend your time, then download IUverse now. But if you're not an IU fan, then what are you even doing here? Go listen to "Eight" on repeat until you understand what real music is.
